# Co-Salient Object Detection with Uncertainty-aware Group Exchange-Masking

The results of our method on CoSal2015, CoSOD3k, CoCA, MSRC, and iCoseg are available, and they can be downloaded from the link \
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uRwH5Y1HgDvxWd9gwRoR9g, and the password is 1310.

The pretrained_model and weights can be downloaded from the link \
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_FVoR6QP6FeQCZEGxgyZog and the password is 1310.

Putting the pretrained_model into ./pretrained_model and weights files into ./result/models and run coseg_test.py can get the results.

### Installation Instructions
    - Python 3.8
    - Pytorch 2.1.1(CUDA 12.1 build).
Please see `requirements.txt` for all the other requirements.

### Train on coco-seg
When you initially train the method, you need firstly train vqvae and pixelcnn

Train vqvae

    python train_VQVAE.py
Train pixelcnn

    python train_pixelcnn.py
Train our Method

    python main.py --data_root /home/dell/Codes/IJCV/data/  --trainset coco-seg --n_embedding 128 --n_dim 384 --color_level 128 --linear_dim 128 --save_vqvae ./checkpoints/vqvae --save_gen_model ./checkpoints/vqvae
### Test on CoCA, CoSOD3k, CoSal2015
Test on CoCA

    python coseg_test.py --n_embedding 128 --n_dim 384 --color_level 128 --linear_dim 128
